Decreasing learning rate to 0.5 (alpha) and increasing exploration helps

decreasing learnign rate to 0.1, and setting negative reward for holes helped even more. ~75% win on 50 games with <20 steps
  
  epsilon = 0.7
  total_episodes = 200
  max_steps = 100

  alpha = 0.05 # learning rate
  gamma = 0.9 #discount factor
